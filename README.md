# Project "Website Layout Based on a Design"

## Project Description

This project is a training exercise aimed at creating a website layout based on a given design using only HTML and CSS. The website has been made responsive using media queries to ensure it looks good both on desktop and smaller screens.

  - **reset.css**: Additional style resets for certain elements.
- **/js**: Folder with JavaScript files:
  - **main.js**: Main script for the site.
